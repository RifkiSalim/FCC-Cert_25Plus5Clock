# 25+5 Clock

## Overview

This 25+5 Clock (also known as the Pomodoro Clock) is the final part of my entries to the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification. It was designed to be simplistic, yet functionally similar to the [25+5 Clock Example](https://25--5-clock.freecodecamp.rocks/) provided by FCC.

### Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS with custom styles

## Features

- **Work Timer:** An adjustable timer that counts down from 25 minutes by default, allowing users to focus on work or study sessions.
- **Break Timer:** A timer that counts down from 5 minutes by default, providing a short break between work sessions.
- **Auto Timer Switching:** Timers automatically switch from Session to Break and vice versa.
- **Pause and Reset:** The ability to pause and reset the timer for better control and flexibility.

2. Navigate to the project folder.

3. Install project dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server.

5. Open your web browser and access the development server's URL (http://localhost:3000) to view and use the 25+5 Clock.

6. Adjust the session and break timers as needed, then start the timer.

7. Click the pause button to pause the timer or reset to start over.
